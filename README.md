It is necessary to implement a neural network that calculates the result of a given logical operation. Then implement functions that will simulate the work of the constructed model. The functions must take a tensor of input data and a list of weights. There should be implemented 2 functions:
1. A function in which all operations are implemented as element-by-element operations over tensors
2. The function in which all operations are realized using operations over tensors from NumPy

To check if the functions work correctly you need:
1. initialize the model and get weights from it (How to get layer weights, How to get a list of model layers)
2. Run the dataset through the untrained model and the implemented 2 functions. Compare the results.
Train the model and get weights after training.
4. Run dataset through the trained model and implemented 2 functions. Compare the results
Note: Since the set of all observations is limited, training can be performed on the whole dataset without control.
